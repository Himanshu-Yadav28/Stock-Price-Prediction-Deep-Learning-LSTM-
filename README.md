# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM 

This project focuses on forecasting stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time series analysis. The model is trained using historical stock data and can predict future prices based on past trends.

Additionally, the project includes real-time stock price tracking using the Yahoo Finance API.

## Key Objectives

- Fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.

- Preprocesses and normalizes data for LSTM training.

- Builds and trains an LSTM neural network to predict stock prices.

- Visualizes actual vs. predicted stock prices.
